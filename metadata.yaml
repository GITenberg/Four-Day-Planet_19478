description: 'Fenris isn''t a hell planet, but it''s nobody''s bargain. With 2,000-hour
  days and an 8,000-hour year, it alternates blazing heat with killing cold. A planet
  like that tends to breed a special kind of person: tough enough to stay alive and
  smart enough to make the best of it. When that kind of person discovers he''s being
  cheated of wealth he''s risked his life for, that kind of planet is ripe for revolution.'
